## About

This project marks the beginning of my journey during the first sprint of my bootcamp at IT Academy in Barcelona. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to share what I've accomplished.

## Project Overview

- Learning the Basics: During this sprint, I dove into the fundamentals of web development, specifically HTML5 and CSS3. I've had the opportunity to work on practical examples that showcase how web mockups come to life. These are the same techniques used by professional web designers to create functional and visually appealing websites.

- Responsive Design: One of the key takeaways from this project is the ability to create a responsive layout. I've successfully designed a web layout that seamlessly adapts to different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- Hands-on Experience: This project provided me with hands-on experience in handling crucial aspects of web design, such as managing images, positioning elements, and structuring a webpage effectively.

## Goals

ðŸŽ¯ The primary objective of this project was to learn how to design a website. Through practical application, I've not only achieved this goal but also gained a deeper understanding of web development concepts.

ðŸŽ¯ This project represents the first step in my web development journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and building upon the skills I've acquired.
